A counter tool is provided to support convenient and rapid tallies.
A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. It is a collection where elements are
stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. Counts are allowed to
be any integer value including zero or negative counts.
The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages. Elements are counted from an
iterable or initialized from another mapping or counter.
As a dict subclass, Counter inherited the capability to remember insertion order. Math operations
on Counter objects also preserve order. Results are ordered according to when an element is first
encountered in the left operand and then by the order encountered in the right operand.
